 * mlx5 host-driver-side VF migration / CRIU restore - control plane.
 * See vfmig.h for the architecture overview.
 *
 * Lifetime model
 * --------------
 * One struct mlx5_vfmig_pf is created per PF mlx5_core in mlx5_vfmig_pf_init()
 * and destroyed in mlx5_vfmig_pf_cleanup(). It owns:
 *   - a cdev under /dev/mlx5_vfmig/<bdf>
 *   - a back-pointer to the PF mlx5_core_dev
 *   - lists of open LOAD_VHCA_STATE / SAVE_VHCA_STATE sessions
 *     (mlx5_vfmig_load_ctx / mlx5_vfmig_save_ctx)
 *
 * Userspace can hold the cdev (or any anon-inode fd) open across PF
 * unbind. cdev_del() does NOT wait for in-flight callers, so we use:
 *   - kref:    keeps the struct alive while any fd or ioctl holds a
 *              reference. Initial ref taken in pf_init(), released in
 *              pf_cleanup(). cdev open() takes a ref, cdev release()
 *              drops it. Each LOAD/SAVE session also takes a ref for
 *              the lifetime of its anon-inode fd.
 *   - lock:    rwsem protecting pf_mdev / dead. ioctl handlers, load
 *              fd .write handlers, and save fd .read handlers down_read()
 *              and bail with -ENODEV if dead. pf_cleanup() down_write()s
 *              once to neuter the cdev and synchronously tear down all
 *              session firmware resources before pf_mdev is freed by
 *              mlx5_uninit_one().
 *   - ctxs_lock: mutex protecting load_ctxs and save_ctxs list
 *              mutations and the cross-list "is vf_id already busy?"
 *              check. Held over open's "claim vf_id + list_add" and
 *              release's list_del. Never held while invoking fput().
 *
 * Lock order:
 *      vfmig->lock  ->  vfmig->ctxs_lock  ->  ctx->io_lock
 * pf_cleanup holds vfmig->lock for write, which blocks all readers; the
 * list walks inside pf_cleanup therefore need no further locking.

/*
 * VFMIG_WIRE_TAG_STREAM_HEADER
 * ----------------------------
 * vfmig-private. The very first record in any vfmig SAVE blob.
 * Carries:
 *
 *   - A magic ("VMIG") so a non-vfmig parser, or a vfmig parser
 *     pointed at a corrupt/foreign blob, refuses early instead of
 *     wandering into the FSM.
 *
 *   - A format version. There is exactly one defined value today
 *     (VFMIG_STREAM_VERSION). The field exists for forward
 *     compatibility: a future format-incompatible change bumps it
 *     and the LOAD parser refuses unknown values with -EOPNOTSUPP
 *     instead of silently misinterpreting fields. There is no
 *     down-version compatibility -- old SAVE blobs that predate this
 *     header don't exist outside development trees.
 *
 *   - The number of HOST_PAGE records that follow. Used by the
 *     LOAD parser as the gate for verifying @manifest_crc32 and as
 *     the trigger to reset the destination IOVA cursor before the
 *     FW_DATA record is staged.
 *
 *   - The number of HOST_USER_PAGE records that follow (always
 *     emitted AFTER all HOST_PAGE records). Always 0 on a kernel
 *     without user_mr_dma stage-2 source-side retag callsites
 *     (C6..C10 of the stage-2 series), so old SAVE blobs and fresh
 *     SAVE blobs from a tracked VF with no MR/CQ/QP/SRQ activity
 *     remain byte-equal to the pre-stage-2 format. Lives in the
 *     low 4 bytes of what used to be @reserved; the upper bytes
 *     stay zero for forward compatibility (older LOAD parsers
 *     don't validate them either way).
 *
 *   - A 32-bit CRC of the (slot, instance_key, iova, len) tuples
 *     of every HOST_PAGE record followed by the (flags, reserved,
 *     instance_key, iova, len) tuples of every HOST_USER_PAGE
 *     record, in the order they appear on the wire. This is a
 *     transport-integrity check at the identity level only;
 *     per-page contents are not in the CRC because the FW_DATA
 *     record's MKEY-based read covers any DMA-payload corruption.
 *     HOST_USER_PAGE records carry no contents at all -- only
 *     identity. A mismatch is -EPROTO, not -EIO -- some record's
 *     identity tuple got mangled in transit. With zero
 *     HOST_USER_PAGE records the fold is byte-equal to the
 *     pre-stage-2 CRC, so old and new blobs are wire-compatible
 *     for the no-user-records case.
 *
 * Tag value 0x4853 is "HS" (host-stream). Chosen well clear of the
 * VFIO mlx5 {0, 1} tag range. NOT marked OPTIONAL.
 *
 * VFMIG_WIRE_TAG_HOST_PAGE
 * ------------------------
 * vfmig-private. Carries a single deterministic-IOVA page snapshot
 * from the source VF's vfmig_iova_domain into the destination VF's
 * vfmig_iova_domain via vfmig_iova_replay_page(). One record per
 * source registry entry, in IOVA-ascending order. SAVE emits these
 * BEFORE the FW_DATA record (and AFTER the STREAM_HEADER record) so
 * that by the time the FW_DATA record is staged into the
 * pending_load slot, every IOVA the FW state references already
 * maps to a populated page in the destination's domain.
 *
 * Tag value 0x4842 is "HB" (host-buffer). NOT marked OPTIONAL: a
 * HOST_PAGE-bearing blob fed to a parser that doesn't understand
 * the tag should fail loudly with -EOPNOTSUPP, because silently
 * dropping the IOVA payload would mean a successful LOAD followed
 * by a dead VHCA -- the very failure mode the IOVA work exists to
 * eliminate.
 *
 * Per-record layout:
 *   [16 B] vfmig_wire_header   { record_size, flags=0, tag=HOST_PAGE }
 *   [40 B] vfmig_host_page_record { slot_id, instance_key, iova,
 *                                   len, flags }
 *   [len B] page contents, len % VFMIG_IOVA_GRANULE == 0
 *
 * record_size = sizeof(struct vfmig_host_page_record) + len.
 *
 * @flags is reserved-must-be-zero. Future bits will gate optional
 * per-page metadata (e.g. content CRC, IOVA mapping flags); a parser
 * encountering any unknown bit set must reject the record. Keeping
 * the field zero today lets us add bits later without re-bumping
 * VFMIG_STREAM_VERSION.
 *
 * VFMIG_HOST_PAGE_MAX_LEN is a defense-in-depth cap so a corrupt or
 * malicious blob can't kvmalloc the host out of memory before we
 * even reach the IOVA-window range check. 16 MiB is far above any
 * single registry entry the layered restore plan emits today
 * (PAGE_SIZE for cmd ring / FW pages / DMA coherent allocations).
 *
 * VFMIG_WIRE_TAG_HOST_USER_PAGE
 * -----------------------------
 * vfmig-private. Carries the identity of a single external
 * (USER_PAGE-slot) registry entry from the source VF's
 * vfmig_iova_domain into the destination's vfmig_iova_domain via
 * vfmig_iova_replay_external(). Identity-only: no page contents.
 * The destination installs an @awaiting_bind = true placeholder
 * (no iommu_map, no phys page) which user_mr_dma stage 3 binds in
 * place when the user-mode RESTORE_x verb fires on the destination.
 *
 * One record per external entry whose @instance_key has a non-zero
 * VFMIG_HUOBJ_KIND() byte -- i.e. per uobject (MR / DBR / CQ / QP /
 * SRQ) that had a source-side retag callsite fire. Auto-numbered
 * entries (kind == VFMIG_HUOBJ_KIND_NONE) are skipped because they
 * have no stable identity for the destination to bind to -- the
 * source's vfmig_dma_ops.map_sg installed them as part of stage 1
 * but no retag callsite has claimed them yet. On a kernel without
 * stage-2 retag callsites the SAVE walk skips every external entry
 * and the blob stays byte-equal to pre-stage-2 format.
 *
 * Tag value 0x4855 is "HU" (host-user). NOT marked OPTIONAL: a
 * blob bearing HOST_USER_PAGE records fed to a parser that does
 * not understand the tag must fail loudly with -EOPNOTSUPP --
 * silently dropping them would leave the destination with a FW
 * state that references user buffers the IOMMU does not know
 * about, exactly the failure mode user_mr_dma exists to prevent.
 *
 * Per-record layout:
 *   [16 B] vfmig_wire_header   { record_size = 32, flags=0,
 *                                tag=HOST_USER_PAGE }
 *   [32 B] vfmig_host_user_page_record { flags=0, reserved=0,
 *                                        instance_key, iova, len }
 *
 * Slot is implicit (always VFMIG_SLOT_USER_PAGE) -- HOST_USER_PAGE
 * is reserved for that slot. @instance_key is the source's
 * VFMIG_HUOBJ_KEY(kind, fw_id) blob. @iova is the source's
 * deterministic USER_PAGE IOVA for the umem range; the destination
 * replays at the SAME iova (the vfmig_iova_domain is symmetric
 * across LOAD because the per-VF window is FW-allocated and
 * preserved by LOAD_VHCA_STATE). @len is the umem range's PAGE_SIZE-
 * aligned byte length; the placeholder install path validates
 * @iova + @len fits within the USER_PAGE window of the destination.
 *
 * @flags is reserved-must-be-zero (future per-record metadata
 * gating); @reserved completes 8-byte alignment of @instance_key.

 *
 * Populated when a LOAD anon-inode fd is closed after a complete blob
 * has been staged into DMA-mapped pages. Consumed by the VF's probe in
 * mlx5_function_enable() via mlx5_vfmig_vf_apply_pending_load(), which
 * walks the VFIO mlx5 destination arc:

 *   SUSPEND_VHCA(INITIATOR) -> SUSPEND_VHCA(RESPONDER)

 * Why this is a separate slot rather than just running the FW commands
 * inside the LOAD ioctl: at LOAD-ioctl time the destination VF is

 * belong to the PF mdev that owned the LOAD ioctl. They MUST be torn
 * down before that PF mdev unbinds; mlx5_vfmig_pf_cleanup() and

 *     attach it to the VF, stash it on vfs_ctx[].vfmig_iova_dom,
 *     and set the flag. After this point dma_alloc_coherent on

 *     is displaced); only callers routed through
 *     vfmig_iova_alloc_slot() will resolve to a valid IOVA.

 * blob is staged-but-unapplied would invalidate IOVAs the staged
 * blob expects to find at apply time. We don't yet enforce this
 * (Layer 1 will, once HOST_PAGE records actually populate the

 * pointing into a freed domain, which apply_pending_load will

 *
 * VF mdev lookup
 *   CREATE_UCTX has no other_function variant; the command must
 *   target the VF's own VHCA via its own mdev's cmdif. We:
 *     1. Resolve the VF's pci_dev from (pf_pdev, vf_id) via
 *        vfmig_get_vf_pdev() (refcounted, must put on exit).
 *     2. Take the VF pci_dev's device_lock so ->dev.driver and
 *        drvdata are stable -- this is the same lock the PCI core
 *        takes around probe/remove.
 *     3. Match the bound driver by name (KBUILD_MODNAME) rather
 *        than by pci_driver pointer; mlx5_core_driver is static in
 *        main.c and we don't want to add a back-door export just
 *        for this debug ioctl.
 *     4. Fetch vf_mdev via pci_get_drvdata() and verify
 *        MLX5_INTERFACE_STATE_UP -- the cmdif is only valid then.
 *
 * Why we destroy immediately
 *   We're probing the *allocator state*, not creating a usable
 *   uctx. Holding a uid alive across the ioctl would (a) leak it
 *   on every probe, and (b) perturb the allocator we're trying to
 *   measure. Destroy-on-the-spot makes back-to-back ioctls return
 *   adjacent values that reveal monotonicity vs reuse. If the
 *   DESTROY_UCTX itself fails after a successful CREATE_UCTX (it
 *   shouldn't on healthy FW), we log and return success with the
 *   measured uid -- the leaked uctx survives only until the next
 *   sriov_numvfs=0 cycle, which is acceptable for an experimental
 *   debug surface.

 * milliseconds before SUSPEND_VHCA(INITIATOR). Default 0 (disabled).
 *
 * Empirical motivation. On the destination, ~6.5ms after the LOAD-time
 * cmd-EQ drain runs, FW emits an unsolicited completion EQE on cmd slot
 * 0 that does not correspond to any host-issued doorbell. Whatever real
 * cmd happens to occupy slot 0 at that wall-clock moment becomes the
 * victim: layer-1 absorbs the stale, but FW evidently considers its
 * slot-0 EQE budget for this LOAD spent and the genuine post-stale
 * doorbell never gets a real completion.
 *
 * One plausible source of the FW-side phantom EQE is timing-sensitive
 * cmd-EQ producer/consumer index bookkeeping at SUSPEND_VHCA. The cmd
 * EQ has a consumer-index (CI) doorbell SW writes to FW each time it
 * consumes EQEs. If SAVE captures FW state after the source kernel has
 * processed an EQE but before the source kernel has written the CI
 * back to FW, FW's view at SUSPEND_VHCA shows "EQE not yet consumed by
 * SW" and on RESUME_VHCA / LOAD_VHCA_STATE the destination FW could
 * legitimately re-emit (or refuse to advance prod_index past) that
 * EQE. A short SAVE-side settle gives the source SW time to push CI
 * doorbell writes (and any other cmd-EQ-related FW handshakes) to FW
 * before the suspend freezes everything.
 *
 * Tradeoff: the sleep is wall-clock cost added to every SAVE session.
 * Sweep small values (5/10/20/50 ms) on the source and check whether
 * the destination's stale-EQE / 60s-cmd-timeout pattern goes away.
 * Default 0 leaves SAVE behavior unchanged.
 *
 * Read once via READ_ONCE so a concurrent param write doesn't change

 * Hot-path lookup contract:
 *
 *   - Read vf_dev->cmd.vfmig_iova_dom directly (set in cmd.c during
 *     the cmd-ring allocation that runs at VF probe time, iff the VF
 *     was vfmig-tracked when probe fired). This is an O(1) load with
 *     no locking. NULL on:
 *       (a) PFs (cmd-ring on PFs never uses the vfmig allocator);
 *       (b) VFs that were not vfmig-tracked at bind time; and
 *       (c) unbound mdevs (the field is cleared on cmd-ring free).
 *
 *   - The same NULL test is also performed at the callsite (see
 *     mlx5_ib's create_real_mr) so that non-vfmig deployments skip
 *     the iova_base/retag_length compute entirely. The check here is
 *     defense-in-depth + the natural way to obtain the dom pointer
 *     we operate on. Both reads avoid the alternative
 *     mlx5_vf_is_vfmig_tracked() + mlx5_vf_get_vfmig_iova_domain()
 *     dance, both of which would acquire pf_mdev->intf_state_mutex
 *     via mlx5_vf_get_core_dev() on every user-MR registration.
 *
 *   - The pointer's lifetime is the VF's bound lifetime: cmd.c clears
 *     it on cmd-ring free, and SET_TRACKED{enable=0} is itself
 *     gated to unbound VFs (see the docstring on
 *     mlx5_vf_get_vfmig_iova_domain), so once we've read non-NULL
 *     here the dom struct cannot be freed underneath us for the
 *     duration of this call.
 *
 * Error mapping:
 *   - -ENOENT (no matching registry entries in the requested range)
 *     converts to 0: the umem went through a DMA path other than
 *     vfmig_dma_ops.map_sg (dmabuf, peer driver, ODP fault path) so
 *     there's nothing to retag. Logging that case would be noise.
 *   - -EEXIST (mkey_index collides with a prior retag) and -EINVAL
 *     (misaligned arguments) propagate unchanged so the mlx5_ib
 *     caller can log a single warning with the offending mkey_index +
 *     iova range. The MR registration itself is not failed on this
 *     path -- v0 treats such an MR as "not CRIU-restorable" but

 *
 * Differs from mlx5_vfmig_retag_user_mr in two ways that justify a
 * dedicated entry point rather than a generic "retag for any kind"
 * helper:
 *
 *   - The instance_key for DBR is VFMIG_HUOBJ_KEY(KIND_DBR, user_virt
 *     & PAGE_MASK). DBR is the only kind whose fw_id is a userspace
 *     virtual address rather than a FW-allocated identifier (no FW
 *     resource owns "the doorbell page" -- the FW only ever sees the
 *     DMA address of individual 8-byte doorbell records inside it).
 *     The destination's Stage-3 bind path needs a stable key that
 *     spans the SAVE -> LOAD boundary; mlx5_ib_db_map_user already
 *     dedups on (mm, user_virt & PAGE_MASK), so we lean on that key.
 *     user_mr_dma.md §6.3 + §A.E.
 *
 *   - The shape is always one PAGE_SIZE entry per doorbell page (the
 *     allocator only ever maps single pages via ib_umem_get(..,
 *     PAGE_SIZE, 0)). Many uobjects in the same ucontext typically
 *     share one DBR page -- libibverbs's mlx5dv allocator hands out
 *     8-byte slots from a single page, so 1 CQ + 1 QP + 1 SRQ
 *     normally land on a single page and produce a single registry
 *     entry. The retag fires once -- in the miss branch of
 *     mlx5_ib_db_map_user, where ib_umem_get actually allocates the
 *     umem -- not on the hit-with-refcount-bump branch.
 *
 * The cmd.vfmig_iova_dom fast path is identical to the MR helper:
 * O(1) lock-free NULL load, fast no-op on PFs / non-vfmig VFs.
 *
 * Error mapping is also identical: -ENOENT collapses to 0 (we expect
 * the registry to have a matching range every time vfmig_dma_ops is
 * the active DMA path, which is precisely the condition cmd.vfmig_iova_dom
 * indicates -- but be defensive in case a future doorbell allocator
 * variant routes around the shim). -EEXIST and -EINVAL propagate so
 * the caller can warn.

 * page back through vfmig_iova_free_slot().
 *
 * On the destination, vfmig_iova_replay_page() during LOAD installed
 * the IOVA mapping and the page contents, but it did NOT touch
 * page_root_xa -- the VF mdev didn't even exist yet (the LOAD ioctl
 * runs on the PF cdev pre-bind). Without this reconstruction step
 * the restored VF probes with an empty page_root for its own
 * function and:
 *
 *   - mlx5_reclaim_root_pages() at teardown finds nothing, returns 0
 *     pages reclaimed; FW thinks it still owns the pages and the
 *     IOVA allocator never frees them -> per-VF leak that grows
 *     unbounded with bind/unbind cycles.
 *   - any FW-initiated MANAGE_PAGES { take_pages } walks the (empty)
 *     rb-tree, returns -EEXIST/0-pages, and FW state diverges from
 *     mlx5_core's view.
 *   - priv->fw_pages and the per-type page_counters[] under-report
 *     by exactly the number of pages LOAD restored, tripping
 *     debug-kernel sanity checks in mlx5_destroy_mkey() and the
 *     pages_debugfs reader.
 *
 * Walks the per-VF deterministic IOVA domain in IOVA-ascending order
 * (matching the source's give-pages order, which is what
 * vfmig_iova_for_each guarantees) and calls
 * mlx5_pages_import_replayed_fw_page() for each FW_PAGE entry. Other
 * slots are skipped -- they live in their own consumer-side
 * lifetime trackers (cmd ring buffer, mlx5_frag_buf, mlx5_db_pgdir)
 * which the corresponding consumer reconstructs on its own probe.
 *
 * MUST run between the destination VF's mlx5_cmd_enable() (which
 * initialises priv->page_root_xa) and any FW give-pages event on the
 * restored VHCA. The current caller is mlx5_function_open()'s
 * restored branch, right after mlx5_vfmig_vf_apply_pending_load()
 * returns success and before the post-LOAD ENABLE_HCA(self) attempt.
 *
 * Returns 0 on success (including the no-domain / no-FW_PAGE-entries
 * case) or a negative errno from the first failed
 * mlx5_pages_import_replayed_fw_page(). On error, partial inserts
 * are NOT rolled back: the pages live in priv->page_root_xa and will
 * be reclaimed by mlx5_reclaim_root_pages() at VF teardown via the

 * detached from its pci_dev by mlx5_core's remove_one() at the tail of
 * device_release_driver(), well before pci_disable_sriov() reaches the
 * device_del() that fires the iommu bus notifier. That hook only runs
 * for *driver-bound* VFs, though. A VF that was made tracked +
 * migratable but never bound to mlx5_core (e.g. the destination VF in
 * a checkpoint/restore measurement, where the user-mode RESTORE_X
 * verbs are intentionally invoked before driver bind) would otherwise
 * keep its iommu_dom attached all the way into pci_disable_sriov(),
 * and the iommu core's BUS_NOTIFY_REMOVED_DEVICE notifier would WARN
 * at drivers/iommu/iommu.c:715 (group->domain != group->default_domain
 * with no driver to "own" the override).
 *
 * Calling iommu_detach_device() on a driver-bound VF here would race
 * its still-active FW DMA (mlx5_pci_close() hasn't drained the cmd
 * ring + EQs yet at this point in the teardown), so we explicitly
 * skip those: vf_pdev->driver != NULL means the VF is bound and the
 * existing remove_one() hook will do the right thing once
 * pci_disable_sriov() walks it.
 *
 * vfmig_iova_domain_detach_dev() sets @dev_detached, so the later
 * vfmig_pf_drop_iova_domains_locked() -> vfmig_iova_domain_destroy()
 * skips the redundant iommu_detach and proceeds straight to
 * iommu_domain_free() + kfree.
 *
 * Caller-side locking matches drop_iova_domains_locked: vfmig->lock is
 * held by the caller; we take ctxs_lock to read each
 * vfs_ctx[].vfmig_iova_dom, then drop ctxs_lock to do the actual
 * detach (which can sleep / take iommu group locks). We do NOT splice
 * the dom out -- the existing drop helper still owns the free path.
