/*
 * Per-VF unmanaged IOVA domain + deterministic slot allocator for
 * mlx5 host-driven VF migration.
 *
 * Why
 * ---
 * SAVE_VHCA_STATE captures, inside the firmware blob, the source
 * VHCA's own IOVAs (cmd ring, host pages, EQ/UAR buffers). On native
 * (non-VFIO, non-VM) mlx5_core the destination's dma-iommu layer hands
 * out fresh, unrelated IOVAs, so after LOAD the firmware would
 * dereference addresses that point nowhere. The fix, built in layers:
 *
 *   1. Give each migratable VF an unmanaged paging iommu_domain that
 *      the PF driver fully owns (this file's domain lifecycle).
 *   2. Lay out a fixed per-VF IOVA window at a high, well-known base so
 *      the source's IOVAs are reproducible on the destination.
 *   3. Provide a slot-tagged allocator (vfmig_iova_alloc_slot) that the
 *      mlx5_core probe path uses instead of dma_alloc_coherent for
 *      every DMA buffer the firmware records an IOVA for. Each caller
 *      declares which kind of allocation it is (CMD_RING, FW_PAGE, ...)
 *      and gets a deterministic IOVA from that slot's dedicated
 *      sub-window (routing of the individual call sites lands in later
 *      patches).
 *
 * Determinism contract
 * --------------------
 * Every converted call site declares which slot its allocation belongs
 * to (enum vfmig_iova_slot). Each slot owns its own VFMIG_IOVA_SLOT_BYTES
 * sub-window and its own bump cursor, so adding, removing, or reordering
 * allocations in one slot cannot shift IOVAs in another -- the per-slot
 * windows are a fixed partition. Within a slot, source/destination IOVA
 * equivalence rests on call-site discipline: the same set of allocations
 * of the same sizes in the same order. The instance_key argument lets a
 * caller pin a specific (slot, key) -> IOVA mapping when it has a stable
 * identifier; passing 0 falls back to per-slot auto-numbering.
 *
 * Coexistence with dma-iommu
 * --------------------------
 * Attaching an IOMMU_DOMAIN_UNMANAGED displaces the device's
 * dma-iommu-managed default DMA domain, so while our domain is attached
 * dma_alloc_coherent() on the VF WILL fail -- nothing routes DMA-API
 * calls into our domain yet. That is intentional: a tracked VF has no
 * usable DMA until the allocator routing lands, so it must stay unbound
 * from its driver while tracked (SET_TRACKED enforces this).

 * the numeric value is the slot's IOVA base offset within the per-VF
 * window, and stable IOVAs are the point of this subsystem.
 *
 *   VFMIG_SLOT_INVALID  -- sentinel; alloc_slot rejects it.
 *   VFMIG_SLOT_CMD_RING -- cmd ring DMA buffer (one per VF), allocated

 * IOVA window layout (hardware-visible addresses).
 *
 *   VFMIG_IOVA_BASE     -- per-PF base, 4 GiB. The window
 *                          [BASE, BASE + N * PER_VF) must fit entirely
 *                          inside the IOMMU's geometry aperture, whose
 *                          upper bound the iommu driver derives from the
 *                          hardware address width (e.g. 39-bit on some
 *                          Intel VT-d -> [0, 0x7fffffffff]). iommu_map()
 *                          returns -ERANGE outside it, so the window is
 *                          validated against the live aperture at attach
 *                          (vfmig_iova_domain_create()) and SET_TRACKED
 *                          fails with -EOPNOTSUPP + a printed diagnostic
 *                          rather than a later opaque cmd-ring DMA
 *                          failure. Base 4 GiB leaves the bottom 4 GiB
 *                          untouched and makes IOVAs visually distinct
 *                          from anything the default allocator produces.
 *                          VFs of the same PF get distinct sub-windows
 *                          (BASE + vf_id * PER_VF) so an IOVA value alone
 *                          identifies the owning VF in dmesg.
 *   VFMIG_IOVA_PER_VF   -- IOVA space per VF, configurable via
 *                          CONFIG_MLX5_VFMIG_IOVA_PER_VF_GIB (GiB;
 *                          default 4). Ample for the cmd ring +
 *                          MANAGE_PAGES host pages + EQ/UAR buffers a
 *                          later layer maps.
 *   VFMIG_IOVA_GRANULE  -- minimum allocation alignment; matches
 *                          PAGE_SIZE (also the mlx5 hardware page size).
