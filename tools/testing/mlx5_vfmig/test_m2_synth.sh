# M2 plumbing smoke-test using a synthesized blob (no VFIO save side).
#
# Validates that the kernel LOAD_VHCA_STATE control plane works end-to-
# end: ioctl returns an fd, parser consumes a real header, PD/MKEY/DMA
# get set up, the LOAD_VHCA_STATE firmware command actually fires, the
# fd cleanly tears down, and a subsequent MARK_RESTORED + bind reaches
# the same probe-time skip as M1'.
#
# What is NOT validated here:
#   * Whether the firmware accepts the bytes -- we feed garbage, so it
#     will reject them ("LOAD_VHCA_STATE ... failed" expected). That's
#     fine: we are testing the *kernel-side* plumbing in isolation.
#
# Usage: sudo PF=0000:00:08.0 ./test_m2_synth.sh
