 * UAPI for mlx5 host-driven VF migration / CRIU restore.
 *
 * One char device per mlx5_core PF, exposed as /dev/mlx5_vfmig/<bdf>.
 * Userspace marks individual VFs as "restored" so that, when those VFs are
 * subsequently bound to mlx5_core, their probe path skips INIT_HCA and
 * instead adopts the firmware state previously installed by LOAD_VHCA_STATE.
 *
 * Lifecycle (destination side):
 *   1. sriov_drivers_autoprobe = 0 on the PF
 *   2. sriov_numvfs = N on the PF        (VFs created, unbound)
 *   3. open /dev/mlx5_vfmig/<pf_bdf>
 *   4. ioctl(MLX5_VFMIG_IOC_LOAD_VHCA_STATE, vf_id)
 *      -> returns a write-only anon-inode fd. Userspace write()s a
 *         VFIO-mlx5-format state blob to it and close()s it.
 *   5. ioctl(MLX5_VFMIG_IOC_MARK_RESTORED, vf_id)
 *   6. driver_override + bind on the VF
 *   7. mlx5_core probe skips INIT_HCA for that VF; subsequent firmware
 *      commands see the state previously installed by step 4.
 *
 * Step 4 is optional in pure M1' tests: skip it if you only care about
 * the INIT_HCA elision. The probe will then succeed up to INIT_HCA but
 * fail at QUERY_ADAPTER with "bad system state" because the firmware
 * refuses post-INIT_HCA commands without state being loaded.

 *     produced by the VFIO mlx5 variant driver in
 *     drivers/vfio/pci/mlx5/. It is a sequence of records, each
 *     prefixed by a 16-byte header (record_size:le64, flags:le32,

 *     (MLX5_MIGF_HEADER_TAG_FW_DATA, kernel-internal name) and are
 *     mandatory; unknown tags marked optional in flags are skipped,
 *     unknown mandatory tags fail the write with -EOPNOTSUPP.
 *     Userspace should treat the entire byte stream as opaque.

 *   Returns 0 with @load_fd populated on success, -EINVAL if vf_id is
 *   out of range or @flags is non-zero, -ENODEV if the PF is gone.
 *   Closing the fd without writing anything is a no-op (no firmware

 *   state into a blob byte-compatible with LOAD_VHCA_STATE's input.
 *
 *   On the ioctl call, the driver synchronously:
 *     - queries the VF's vhca_id via QUERY_HCA_CAP(other_function=1)
 *     - SUSPEND_VHCA(INITIATOR), SUSPEND_VHCA(RESPONDER) to quiesce

 *   then returns @save_fd, an anon-inode fd. Userspace read()s the blob
 *   from it (any chunk size) until EOF. The first read also emits a
